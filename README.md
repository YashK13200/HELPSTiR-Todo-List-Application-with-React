Todo List Application
Overview:
This project is a frontend Todo List application built with React.js + Vite. The application allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively. The key features include creating, updating, and deleting tasks, marking tasks as completed, searching for tasks, and viewing detailed descriptions in an expandable list format.

System Design:
The application uses a component-based architecture with React.js. It leverages the Context API to manage state and facilitate communication between components. The key components and their roles are as follows:

App Component: The root component that manages the state of the todo list and renders the overall layout.
TodoForm Component: A form component for adding new tasks to the list.
TodoItem Component: Displays individual tasks with functionality to edit, delete, and toggle completion status. It also supports expanding to show additional details like description and timestamp of the last update.
TodoContext: A context provider that encapsulates the state management logic for todos, including actions for adding, updating, deleting, and toggling completion of tasks.
Implementation
The core functionality of the application is built using React hooks for state management and the Context API for global state management. The system uses localStorage to persist tasks across browser sessions.

Adding a Task: Users can add tasks using the TodoForm component, which updates the global state via the addTodo function from the context.
Updating a Task: The TodoItem component provides functionality for editing task details and marking tasks as completed or incomplete.
Mark as Done: Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
Searching Tasks: The App component includes a search input that filters tasks based on the query entered by the user.
Expandable List: Tasks can be expanded to reveal additional details, including a description and the timestamp of the last update.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
