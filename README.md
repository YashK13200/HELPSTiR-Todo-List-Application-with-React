# Todo List Application

## Overview

This project is a frontend Todo List application built with React.js. The application allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively. The key features include:

- Creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
- Marking tasks as completed.
- Searching for tasks.
- Viewing detailed descriptions in an expandable list format.

## System Design

The application uses a component-based architecture with React.js. It leverages the Context API to manage state and facilitate communication between components. The key components and their roles are as follows:

- **App Component**: The root component that manages the state of the todo list and renders the overall layout.

- **TodoForm Component**: A form component for adding new tasks to the list.

- **TodoItem Component**: Displays individual tasks with functionality to edit, delete, and toggle completion status. It also supports expanding to show additional details like description and the timestamp of the last update.

- **TodoContext**: A context provider that encapsulates the state management logic for todos, including actions for adding, updating, deleting, and toggling the completion of tasks.

## Implementation

The core functionality of the application is built using React hooks for state management and the Context API for global state management. The system uses `localStorage` to persist tasks across browser sessions.

- **Adding a Task**: Users can add tasks using the TodoForm component, which updates the global state via the `addTodo` function from the context.

- **Updating a Task**: The TodoItem component provides functionality for editing task details and marking tasks as completed or incomplete.
- 
- **Mark as Done Mark**: Allow users to mark tasks as completed..

- **Searching Tasks**: The App component includes a search input that filters tasks based on the query entered by the user.

- **Expandable List**: Tasks can be expanded to reveal additional details, including a description and the timestamp of the last update.
